                        CALLOUT - AI-POWERED REQUEST MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

WHAT IS THIS APP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Callout is a mobile application designed for organizations to manage internal 
requests efficiently using artificial intelligence. It allows members to submit 
requests (like leave applications, purchase orders, travel requests) and 
automatically routes them to the appropriate approver based on the 
organizational hierarchy.

The app uses a local AI model (Ollama with Phi-4) to intelligently classify 
requests and determine their priority level, making the approval process faster 
and more organized.


HOW IT WORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. USER REGISTRATION & AUTHENTICATION
   - Users sign up with email and password
   - Secure authentication powered by Supabase
   - User profiles are automatically created

2. ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT
   - Users can create new organizations (becoming the admin)
   - Users can join existing organizations via join requests
   - Admins approve/reject join requests and assign roles

3. ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY
   The app supports 5 role levels:
   - Admin (Organization owner)
   - CEO
   - Manager
   - Team Leader
   - Member

4. AI-POWERED REQUEST SUBMISSION
   - Members create requests with a title and description
   - The AI analyzes the request in real-time and determines:
     * Request Type (LEAVE, PURCHASE, TRAVEL, EXPENSE, etc.)
     * Importance Level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
     * Relevant metadata extracted from the description
   - Request is automatically routed to the appropriate approver

5. INTELLIGENT ROUTING SYSTEM
   Requests flow through the hierarchy:
   Member → Team Leader → Manager → CEO → Admin
   
   Example: If a Team Member submits a leave request, it goes to their 
   Team Leader. The Team Leader can:
   - Approve it (request complete)
   - Reject it (request denied)
   - Escalate it to their Manager (if needed)

6. APPROVAL WORKFLOW
   - Approvers receive notifications of pending requests
   - They can view full details including AI analysis
   - Actions: Approve, Reject, or Escalate to next level
   - All actions are logged with comments and timestamps

   - Fallback keyword classification works offline
   - For production: host Ollama on a server or use cloud AI APIs

2. Row Level Security:
   - Currently simplified/disabled on some tables for development
   - Should be enhanced before production deployment

3. Email Notifications:
   - Not yet implemented
   - Requires SMTP configuration in Supabase

4. File Attachments:
   - Not supported yet
   - Would require Supabase Storage integration
